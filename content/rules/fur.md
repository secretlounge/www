# Rules for /fur/

Make sure to read the above, the only Global Rules that don't apply to the /fur/ bot are #4 and exception to #8 where you can advertise a channel with furry art in, NOT a telegram group but a CHANNEL, don't advertise channels that advertise groups either.



Below are a list of rules for @furryloungebot on Telegram, they can be updated at any time with notice given in the bot by a mod/adminsay.


{{% ruleify %}}
Do not discuss topics unrelated to furries or the furry fandom. Some off-topic is allowed, but keep it short.

Topics such as politics, guns, and outside drama are NOT allowed and will result in the messages getting removed.

We have a bot for POLITICS over at [/pol/](https://t.me/politicsloungebot), use that instead.

Use a group chat or DMs for drama.
-
Do not post media or discuss topics which are considered "extreme".

We can't post a full list but to get an idea:
- feral¹
- cub/young
- watersports
- scat
- fisting
- vore
- gore
- diapers
- mlp (it isn't "extreme" but we don't allow it)
- hyper/inflation

¹ - we allow feral as long as it isn't realistic looking renders/media, human x feral or creepy looking
If a mod sees something you post as extreme and it is removed and you feel as if it wasn't, leave a message in the Support Bot and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
-
Adding to [Global Rule #8]({{< ref "#g8" >}}), advertising is also saying the name of a channel/group/bot without the @ before it, as well as splitting up the name. E.g. "It's in furry lounge bot"
-
Do not complain about content you don't like, delete it your side and move on. Everyone has different tastes.
-
Adding to [#4]({{< ref "#r4" >}}), any complaining about media (unless against the rules) will be removed.
-
If you would like someone to message you, you can sign your message (e.g. /s message me for dick pics) and it will sign your name at the end of your message. Abusing this feature will result in a blacklist, we don't want constant namefags with this.
-
Adding to [Global Rule #10]({{< ref "#g10" >}}), calling someone out will result in a cooldown given, this is an anon bot and we don't care if X fucked Y.
-
We do not tolerate hate speech or targeting of users whether they are in the bot or not.
-
Do not complain that X breaks rules if it doesn't, an don't be a smartass when a mod or admin tells you to move on.
